  **In December 2022, we went to comic art classes. We told stories to each
  other, drew comics, and made up characters. In March 2023, we published the
  book.**

  The book contains the stories of Ukrainian teenagers who are now scattered around the world because of the war.

It is important to write down what is happening around us and what is on our mind; to talk about what is important to us and share things that help us deal with the new reality. These are the stories we wish to tell. Not all of them are about the war, but they all came out of it.

You can order a PDF or a printed version. The money from sales will cover the printing and delivery costs. The remaining amount will be donated to Ukrainian refugee funds <a href="https://choosetohelp.ge/" target="_blank">"Choose to Help"</a> и <a href="https://helpingtoleave.org/en" target="_blank">"Helping to Leave"</a>.

The stories are written in Ukrainian with English translation.
