# About the project

«I am here» — is a project devoted to stories that Ukrainian teenagers are ready to share during the war. We have assembled an editorial team that consists of guys who found themselves in Georgia in 2022. Along with curators, they have developed this website and continue to fill it with stories and the results of creative projects.

It is difficult to be a teenager, especially during historical times. That is why we would like to write about what concerns us, about what interests us and what helps us get through. We hope that our stories will help someone feel less lonely. And we will be glad to those who want to join us.

## «I am here» is here

The project has began in August of 2022 in Tbilisi with a series of workshops with teenagers from Ukraine. We met twice a week for a month to create a website to tell our stories honestly, to put our struggles into articles. For that we needed to figure out how online storytelling works, try out design and basics of web development. The first version of the site was released by a editorial team of four Ukrainian teenagers: Sasha Trach, Katya Trach, Maksim Vasilenko, Vika Globets.

All stories and reflections are published on the site. You can read it. Helping curators: Sasha Patlukh, Lisa Marantidi, Vadim Matveev, Julia Miocen, Alexey Garmash.

## Project progress

After the launch, like-minded people in different parts of the world noticed IMHR.top and began to offer various assistance. So, Ilya Kurylenko found out about us through the <BlankLink path="https://t.me/itstartline">IT Start Line</BlankLink> community in Berlin. Ilya is from Poltava, he is 17 and he knows how to code. He suggested the improvement of the site and took up its technical support.

Meanwhile, volunteers began to write to us. With their help, we translate the site into English and transcribe interviews for new articles.

## Workshops

Getting together in one place and doing something that can then be shown to the world is great. When curators who are ready to teach teenagers anything devoted to storytelling come along, we gather a new group and start studying. It is not like education, we rather start to be friends, doing some new things together. In these projects, we reflect the teenager's view of what is happening in Ukraine, interpersonal relationships, and surrounding reality.

Now we are preparing a comic book. The artist Sasha Avilova helps us in this. We
plan to print the first edition and show it to the world. These comics will contain
our view of what is happening around.
