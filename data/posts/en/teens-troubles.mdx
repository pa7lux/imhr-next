    # How to support a teenager these days?
  </BigHeading>

    **Unlike most other teenagers from Ukraine who came here because of the war, I have been living in Tbilisi for 8 years. My name is Vika, I am 14 years old, and I moved here from Kyiv, where I still have many friends and family. I really feel sorry for the adults, kids and teenagers, caught up in the war in Ukraine.**

    **In my article I would like to draw attention to problems teenagers face in their adolescence.  I constantly observe my social circle and see that many are in need of support, especially now.**

    Teenagers from around the world struggle in different ways, including my peers, so I will feature their stories. These stories are very personal, filled with pain and deep emotions, so I left them anonymous. At the end of each story, I asked my heroines to try to explain how their lives would improve if their circumstances changed. But to understand what it takes to change these circumstances, some expertise is required; so I also asked a professional psychologist to comment on each story.

    I believe that this article could help parents understand what teens go through, and also help teens feel like they are not alone in their struggles. If you have a story that you’d like to share, please text our Telegram bot and I’ll try and add it in the article.

    My sister and I are misunderstood by our family;, they tell us that as teenagers we don’t have rights. When we fight with our parents, they tell us that we own nothing in this house. Our father tells us that he’s ashamed of us and that we’re untalented; our mother can occasionally raise a hand against us. Thank God everything is good with my friends.

        ## To the parents
        Despite the fact that teenagers depend on adults financially and socially, they have a right to emotional security and care.

        If you want your children to respect and support you once they reach adulthood, it is necessary that you to show them the same attitude at an early age. Violation of their boundaries, physical and emotional violence, on the other hand, leaves a long trail of psychological trauma and prevents normal relationships from developing in the future.

        Make the choice of what kind of relationship you want to have with your children: warm and supportive, or detached and hostile?

        ## To the teenagers

        It is really difficult to face rejection from your closest relatives when instead you want to understand each other and builda mutually respectful household.

        Unfortunately, it is not in our power to make parents listen to children’s needs and value them, if they themselves do not consider this important. It is good that you and your sister have each other and that you are surrounded by good friends. Continue to share your emotions and support each other.

        If you feel physically unsafe because your parents raise a hand against you, try to find a trusted adult (it may be a school psychologist or a teacher) who you can  find methods of protection.

    Everything is complicated in my family. My father left us when I was 10. At first my mom was depressed, but then she met my stepfather, Valentin. We have a good relationship with Valentin. In a sense, he replaced my dad. But sometimes my mom gets jealous of my relationship with him, and beats me. We often quarrel and yell at each other. Friends and classmates sometimes laugh that I have a stepfather, and ask, ‘Where is your dad?’ with smirks on their faces. It’s hurtful.

        ## To the parents
        The end of a relationship with a spouse is very painful and it may take a lot of time to heal.  It is good if you manage to move on and to build a new relationship. At the same time, you should remember that a breakup with a partner and the integration of a new one into the family is stressful not only for you, but for your teenage child as well. Teenagers are very sensitive to conflicts and changes in the family and need careful support.

        In this story the mother’s choice also affects how the child is perceived by her peers. The mother’s capacity for nuance and understanding is very important. If school is a tough environment, and the home also becomes a place of quarrels, physical threat, emotional tension, then where can a child be protected and supported? A child, regardless of age, must have an opportunity to rely on their parents for,support at a time of need and be heard.

        ## To the teenagers

        Schoolmates can be harsh, especially because they may not realize why they make someone an object of ridicule. Sometimes they just repeat what they hear from adults around them. You should not take everything they say personally. There are a lot of different families and relationships in the world, and not a single one is better or worse than the others. Every person has the right to have a lifestyle they prefer with a person they like and there are a lot of people in the world who understand that.Eventually, you will meet understanding people.

        Unfortunately, it is not easy to influence the feelings of other people, like your mother. Parting with your father must have been a huge trauma for her and now she is worried about her relationship with your stepfather, and is afraid of losing him. This may lead to her seeing threats to their relationship even where there are none.

        It is sad that you are not on the same boat with her. Hopefully, as time passes, your mom will begin to feel more secure and stop attacking you. In any case, if you have a trusting adult or a friend, who can support you, do not hesitate to ask them for help.

    ## T.G, 13, Budapest, Hungary

    My parents are not concerned about my life. When I feel bad, I mainly hear "stop faking it!" as a response. When I come home from school and tell them that I'm being bullied, mom tells me it’s my fault. During moments like these I feel really offended. They also say things like, "if you dislike something, it’s not too late to find a new family." And once, when I gave an example of a better relationship in another family, the response I received was "maybe they can adopt you?".

        ## To the parents
        It is crucial to treat other people's feelings seriously, regardless of their age. If your daughter says that her relationship with classmates is not working, you have no reason to not trust her words or shift responsibility. During adolescence, relationships with peers can have a profound psychological impact, and it can be difficult to fit in. There are a lot of cases of bullying in schools, where children become objects of humiliation and ridicule. 
        
        It is your responsibility as a parent to not make a situation at school that your daughter deals with even worse by rejecting and distrusting her.It is your duty to understand the situation, and to support her in improving her relationships with classmates.

        ## To the teenagers

        It must be very painful to expect support and understanding from your mother only to hear that it is your fault in response. And it must  be even more painful to not find support among your peers. Take some time to think if there is at least one person in your surroundings with whom you like to spend time. Maybe these are not people who are particularly close to you, but with whom you have shared interests?
        
        Every person needs a safe space and, unfortunately, it is not always a family. It takes time to find the people with whom you feel calm and warm.

    ## M.K., 15, Tbilisi, Georgia

    I’m 15 and half of my childhood was like a sweet dream. I loved my dad more than anything in the world. When I turned 8, everything changed. My parents’ relationship worsened; my sister and I would hear them screaming and we began to worry. We understood that was the end of their relationship. Dad told us that mom was cheating on him. I trusted dad without listening to mom. One time, our broke in and started beating our mother before my eyes. I started screaming. The neighbors ran in to help my mom.

    My problem is that I cannot forget and let go of the past.These traumatic memories of my dad beating my mom are killing me, I didn’t want thingsit to end this way. Seven years have passed since then, I have a stepfather and a brother. But I would give anything to bring my dad back to the family, even though I know it's impossible. I would like to wish myself to have a full and healthy family in my next life.

    After my stepfather and a brother joined the family, it began to feel like my life was turned upside  down. Nobody notices me, as if I’m not present at this household anymore, and nobody is interested in my opinion. I frequently fight with the family and in response they call me “ungrateful” or say, why did I even give birth to you? Usually in these situations, nobody in my family takes my side.  I wonder if I will become happier when I move out? Only three years left to wait.  I will not rest until I do this, I feel like I’m losing my mind and I am very tired of living in such a madhouse.Also, my sister’s boyfriend always snaps at me. He raises his hand at me but then tells my mother that he didn’t lift a finger. And my sister backed up his lie.confirmed it. It’s moments like this that hurt me the most.

    I have problems with school. I left after 9th grade and I don’t know where to go next. I haven’t told anyone the reason why I left, I just said that I don’t want to go to school anymore. But this is not the case at all: I always loved to walk around school even if I wasn’t studying. I left because I trusted my friend with my phone password and he shared something private to his friend. Since then we haven’t talked, and the whole class started thinks bad of me. They teased me with insults after school and I was tired of it, so I left. I hope I  can manage to change my life:  I’ll get accepted to college and find good friends, who will not only know me for my bad qualities. 
    
    This year started very well. I couldn’t believe that everything was getting better in my life for the first time. But since the beginning of summer everybody started quarreling with me, all of my close friends started leaving me, telling me that I changed for the worse. I want to believe that I’m the same as everyone else. Everybody who I really loved left. At the moment I am worried about only one of my friends Even if everyone dumped me and she was the only one left, nobody is gonna bother me. Maybe I really have changed. Everybody says that I’m bad, but I haven’t done anything bad. Maybe if I let go of the past everything will change. It would be so much easier if my family understood me. And if my friends loved me for who I am, I think that everything would get better. I want it too much.

        ## To the parents
        Getting through teenage years is a challenge both for the parents and for the teens themselves. It may not be easy for all members of the family, but on the parent's side there is more responsibility for understanding the situation and rebuilding relationships, since adults have more social experience and opportunities to manage themselves.
        
        Teenagers often hide their acute need for a parent’s love and attention behind rude, challenging and generally unpleasant behavior. They want to become more independent while maintaining an adult’s support and care at the same time. It may be very emotionally challenging to notice this need behind the protests, let alone to overcome your own irritation and anger at this behavior But it is still worth doing, because your relationship with your teenager can determine your relationship in the future. If it is difficult to manage on your own, it is possible to consult a therapist.
      
        ## To the teenagers

        It is painful to lose a person you love, especially if it is a parent. So it is understandable why even after all these years you want to get everything back and return to the happiest years of your life. Unfortunately, it is not our power to turn back time. However, we can save these warm memories, turn them into a valuable source a sort of inner treasure that always stays with you and which you can tap into during hard times to feel loved and empowered. Also we try to build around ourselves environments filled with relationships with people who you will value and love and they will do the same back.

        Sometimes it is easier done from scratch in a new social circle. At times, the closest people turn out to be not the relatives, but friends with shared interests, views and values. That is why if you want to find authentically close people, it is worth asking yourself the following questions: what is important for me to find in others, what is important for me in myself, what kind of a friend and a family member do I want to be, what attitude I would like to show? It is also important to remember that bridges are always being built from both sides, so the desire to work it out must be mutua. Even if you do everything you can, others also need to make an effort to establish contact with you. Only then can we expect mutual understanding.
