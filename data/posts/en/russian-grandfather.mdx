  ## The Story from my life in Odessa

  My name is Olya, I'm 12 years old and I'm from Odessa. In March I went to Tbilisi, then briefly returned to Odessa, now I live in Romania.
  We have a big private house in Odessa. It used to be divided into three parts. In one part I lived with my mother and father. In another part — my grandmother and grandfather. And in the third — my aunt and my cousin sister. When the war started, grandmother and grandfather immediately began to support the Russian Federation. Since 2008 they have been following the Russian news.

  Once grandma invited us to tea and grandpa came and started talking something about politics. I didn't get angry, I just quietly said to myself, "If you love Russia so much, then suitcase — train station — Russia." He started yelling at my mother, "Who did you raise?!"

  I'm a fourth generation Odessan on my mother's side and third generation on my father's side. But grandfather says that this whole area is Russia, so he says that I'm Russian, and he's Russian, and all Russians. I don't believe that, I tell him that Odessa belongs to Ukraine.

  In general, it was very hurtful. When we left, he didn't call me or my mother, nor did he ask how we were. On my birthday he didn't even call, he just sent a message on Viber with the words "Happy Birthday". They also allowed my aunt and cousin to stay in our part of the house, and now they don't want to leave, and we don't know where to go back to, but somehow we'll talk to them. Grandma is at least trying to keep in touch with my mom, and Grandpa doesn't want to talk to us at all. That's it.
