  At 6 in the morning, on the 24th of February, my girlfriend called me and told: “Sasha, the war has begun”. I said “Huuuuh?” and went back to sleep. Within the next couple hours, I woke up to the sound of bombings. I was very scared- it was very scary to stay at home. The next day I started to convince my mother to go to Tbilisi, Georgia. My mother is from Georgia and we have many relatives living there. She wasn’t most amused by my idea however, as she didn’t know who could care for our pets. To clear my mind, I went to sleepover at a neighbor’s house. While I was there, my mother fell down the stairs and broke her arm. This turn of events caused her to categorically disagree with the idea of going anywhere… but nothing is impossible for my aunt. Within a week, my aunt, who is one of my mother's sisters, convinced my mom to leave Odessa. On the 18-19th of March, my mom told me to pack my stuff. In the morning of the 20th we began our trip to the Georgian consulate. Around 9am, my dad met us with chocolates and traditional sausages, and we said our goodbyes.

  ## Odessa-Kishinev

  My aunt told us that the Georgian consulate has organized a complementary exit out of Odessa for its citizens. As it turned out, my mother changed her citizenship to Ukrainian so we had to pay for everything. They put us on a tiny Soviet-made bus which was also packed with tons of luggage. We drove for around 4 hours to Kishenev’s Georgian consulate where we were told to take another bus to Bucharest.

  During the trip, I listened to this track a lot:

  ## Kishinev-Bucharest

  We were stuck for the longest time at the Moldova customs- around five hours. This was the most boring stop of all. We were almost squeezed to death when waiting in the line full of cars.

  The only bright moment was that we ate a lot of candy. Eventually we were told to take out all the luggage so the border patrol could check it all inside out. One of the border-officers’ name was Lev, my brother nicknamed him Lev the Ripper. We arrived to the Georgian consulate at night and we were taken to yet another bus.

  ## Bucharest-Istanbul

  On the Moldova border, we were met with food brought by volunteers. They gave us fruits and sandwiches and continued with the road trip. Bucharest had great many volunteers who took us to the hotel for refugees. We got to rest 8 hours. At 7pm, a consulate representative arrived, took our luggage, and we drove to the next bus. This was the best bus yet; it had tablets with movies and video games. My cousin and I watched Scooby-doo, Deadpool 2, and played candy-crush and Temple run through the night.

  ## Istanbul-Tbilisi

  When we arrived, we awaited exciting adventures. We waited for consulate representative from 7 in the morning, but by noon we were told that he won’t come at all so we boarded the next bus ourselves. We were met by a cigarette-loving chauffeur and many more issues. We waited for our bus to leave for a very long time. When we finally started moving, I took out our sandwiches and juice boxes, and my cousin and I ate and slept the entire way. We drove through a very mountainous terrain for a very long time. It was very boring, the only thing saving me were my headphones and good music. My cousin and I took photos of everything and everyone along the way (mostly we took photos of the mountains because there was nothing else around). We were all very tired and exhausted. We arrived to Tbilisi when it was already late in the night. We were met by my aunt, and we went home. Our relatives met us at the apartment. I was very happy to see them :). On that moment, our 4 days of utter misery have finally ended.
