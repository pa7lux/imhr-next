    # Ukraine and&nbsp;Israel.<br />Two wars, four teenagers
  </BigHeading>
</Large>

<Medium>
  **After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, many young people and their families fled their homes. After Hamas invaded Israel on 7 October, the vast majority of citizens stayed in their homes. We set up a dialogue between four teenagers from the two countries to find out what is similar and different in their perceptions of these two events, how their attitudes to aggression and acceptable responses to it are changing, how the spreading wars are changing their view of the future and what they think can save the world (spoiler: cookies).**

  >### Hello
</Large>

<AuthorCard src='/images/israel/sasha.jpg'>
  My name is Sasha Trach, I'm 14 years old. I moved to Tbilisi from Odessa a year and a half ago. You can read my full story <a href="https://imhr.top/en/posts/odessa-tbilisi">here</a>.
</AuthorCard>

<AuthorCard src='/images/israel/olya.jpg' direction='rtl'>
  I'm Olya, I'm 13, I also left Odessa for Tbilisi, where I lived for 9 months before I moved to Romania where I've been living for the last 10 months. Since leaving, I’ve gone back to Odessa twice for a few days, but because of problems with my relatives I did not stay there.
</AuthorCard>

<AuthorCard src='/images/israel/kot.jpg'>
  My name is Sema Kot, I'm 15. I left Moscow for Israel 1.5 years ago when it became clear that we didn't want to live in a country that had organised a war. I have Jewish roots.

<AuthorCard src='/images/israel/shimon.jpg' direction='rtl'>

  My name is Shimon, I'm 14 years old. I’m from Russia and moved to Israel one year ago.

  **We asked the kids what the start of the war was like for them and how their experiences have changed over time. Sema and Shimon said that they felt relatively safe because of the Iron Dome, and that the biggest problem for them was that they had to stay at home. The most "disgusting" thing is the number of casualties on all sides, and that there will be even more if there is a ground battle rather than aerial and rocket strikes. In general, the previous constant shelling from Palestine was not much different from the current, active phase of the war, "the war is just stronger and scarier." It seems that people outside who follow the news are much more anxious, so Sema suggests not watching TV or reading the news.**

   My mom has a wierd theory that this is because Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. And as a result, we have no other weapons or protection. All our weapons are assembled, so to speak, “by hand” and therefore we do not have our own dome or anything of the sort. And this is because Ukraine gave up its weapons and thereby its protection <i>(we understood this theory to mean that the absence of nuclear weapons reduces the country’s desire to be a military power — ed.)</i>.

   You know, I realize that there is a war going on in my country and it’s in an active phase. Recently a distant relative of mine, a neighbour who lived opposite me, died. Somewhere out there he was at the front and he was killed. And somehow I'm aware of that, but I still want to go back to study. My parents are against it, but I'm going to study in Kiev anyway, I have a lot of friends there. It's the capital, they bomb there all the time, and somehow you understand that the war is going on, but at the same time you feel like you have no other way out. I mean, my parents are considering either going to Canada or going back to Ukraine. It seems clearer to me to go back to Ukraine because I already have a home there. Of course there are problems, but it seems to be easier there.

  **The kids in Israel are repatriates. When asked if they understood what kept them there and why they did not after the outbreak of war in the country, they said that in addition to the relative safety of the Iron Dome, there was a feeling that it would all be over soon — in a few weeks or months.**

    All the new Aliyah people <i>(Aliyah — repatriation, understood in this case as a return to the historic homeland of the Jews in the State of Israel — ed.)</i>, when they hear the first sirens, think: "Oh, that's it, we're leaving". But then they just get used to it.

  **Sema and Shimon said that it was important for them to be with their family in this difficult situation, and that they themselves were at an age when they couldn't really decide where to move to.

    Last year we were at a camp and there were two girls from Israel. One evening we had time for calls and one of them talked to her parents, who told her that there was a war. I was like, "What?! Ah!!! What a nightmare!!!" And she calmly responded: "Well, it'll only be for a week, that's all."

  **We asked the Ukrainian girls how they felt about the simplicity with which the Israeli teenagers perceived what was happening - the boredom of being locked up, the side quests, the certainty that it would all be over soon. Sasha said that at first she and her family were more or less optimistic about what was happening, expecting that it would all be over soon. But after she saw a rocket being shot down with her own eyes, she became very frightened and every time there was a bombing, she would run into the cellar next to the house.**

    I guess the guys feel safe because — I don't want to sound harsh or bitter — but they kind of have it made! Even though they get bombed a lot, they have no problems... Oh my God! How can I say "they have no problems?! Aaah!"... Anyway, the situation there is terrible. The war is a mess. But I understand them. I don't know how it works in their perception, but for me it's that I don't believe in war and I believe in the best. And I'm just so glad that they haven't gone into some kind of depression about it and so on. I have friends who are scared of every plane because of the war in Ukraine.

    We had a siren going on for hours and it was annoying. It made my head spin. We would laugh, cover our ears and shout how annoying it was. Of course, that was when it wasn't so dangerous — not like when houses were on fire or there were fires near the entrances to houses.

  **We asked if the kids in Israel had seen a rocket being shot down — because Sasha described it as a turning point in her behaviour. Shimon and Sema replied that they had seen it a few times, but it didn't seem to make much of an impression on them.**

  **In Israel there are always hostilities (albeit on a different scale). But in Ukraine, too, it all started long before February 24. We asked Sasha and Olya if they knew what would happen in Donbass before 2022. Both replied that they had heard something, but their parents didn't immerse them in it, and in general they were just kids, more interested in sweets than the war. But when the full-scale invasion began, they started to learn more about the history of Ukraine, about Donbass, and "started to think about all of this."**

    I probably started looking into the subject of war when I was about 12-13 years old, in December 2022. Because there were terrible rumours among teenagers and on the internet that there was going to be a war. We were really worried. We didn't think Russia would attack, but we discussed it a lot. And here we are on the evening of the 17th of February, it's snowing, we're happy, nothing has happened. And just a week later you wake up to explosions.

    I remember February 24 well. It felt really heavy. I came to school and from the morning on all the kids were just watching the exchange rate of dollar and it went up a lot. Every time there was a break in our lessons we watched the dollar and it's just etched in my memory.

  **We pointed out that we grew up thinking that wars were something out of the pages of a textbook. Veterans, "never again" and so on. And suddenly all of us, and our interlocutors at a very young age, found ourselves witnesses. What does it feel like when a war starts in a neighbouring country, in your own country? Shimon and Sema agreed that the war with Ukraine was much harder for them emotionally because the Israeli war didn't impossible — from the very beginning, instructions were shown in schools and rockets flying over the city were discussed as a matter of course. Although none of them have family in Ukraine, the war there is more difficult than the one they are in.**
</Medium>

  <DialogBubble people="3">
    When it began in Ukraine, there was no sense of the impossible happening. Our family never shared the views of the Russian government. I remember this heavy feeling in my soul that a war had started there, that our country was attacking a country that had done nothing wrong. It is more difficult for me to experience the war with Ukraine than the war I am in <i>(Sema himself was surprised by this thought when he said it — ed.)</i>.

  **The whole world recognises Russia as the aggressor. Not so with Israel and Hamas. This war has divided society, and the phrase "not everything is black and white" is no longer a calling card of Russian collaborators. Personally, we (the Editors of I am here) cannot deny that the events of 7 October are an unconditional aggression by Hamas. We asked the kids from Israel: how does it feel to be a representative of a country that is acting as an aggressor and then move to a country that is in the position of a victim?**
</Medium>



<Large>
  <DialogBubble people="4">
    First of all, I don't agree with the idea that if you come from Russia, you are its representative. If you've left, it means there's something you don't agree with.

    Yes, and just because they fear for their businesses doesn't mean they want the war with Ukraine to end.
  </DialogBubble>

  **Shimon seemed a little lost at this point, but we went back to the original question and came to the point that fear is felt in both positions. If you are being attacked, of course the fear is more concrete. But if you are from the country of the aggressor, there is shame as well as fear.**
</Medium>

<Large>
  <DialogBubble people="3">
    Actually, I was thinking about the fact that I went from being in an aggressor country to being in a victim country in terms of black humor and the irony of life. Just bad karma. 

    But seriously, while fear is a part of living hear, the fear is much easier to deal with here in Israel because I know that this is a country that has adapted. My room is a bomb shelter and I know that there are a lot of rooms like that in the country. But in Ukraine there is no such adaptation.
  </DialogBubble>

<Medium>
  **We asked whether there were feelings of anger towards the aggressor, as opposed to shame and fear. The kids from Israel replied that they did not feel anger, but rather misunderstanding. Sasha agreed, but admitted that she did not feel anger towards Russia in general, but towards Putin in particular.**
</Medium>

<Large>
  <DialogBubble people="2">
    It's not that there's any hatred — I don't see the point of hatred because it can't influence the situation in any way. As much as it annoys me, ordinary people like me in Russia have no influence on Putin. There should always be a change of government, every four years, not like this. Maybe the older generation choose Putin, but I'm sure the younger generation in Russia are against it. It's nobody's fault. It's just that some old guy has been put in power and that's not going to change. When are you going to die already?!

    You know what they say: "Hate eats you from the inside out." I felt it myself. When the war started, it was very bad for me morally. For the first few weeks I didn't understand anything. Just that you had to go to the car park when there were sirens, that you had to sleep on mattresses and save food because there were no fridges. That's all I could understand. 

    A lot of people I knew were at the front. When I came to Georgia, I found out that the Russian military had killed my classmate and his whole family. It was very hard. And then I felt hatred eating me from the inside. And I feel very ashamed. When you are there [in Ukraine], you think: 'Everyone is safe, healthy, relatives are around, everything is fine. When you are abroad, you worry even more. And I realised I had to do something about it. I started to read less news, I tried to think less about it, I said to myself: "Olya, when it all started, you were a bit confused." Then I found out that there are a lot of people who are against the war, I realized that I have a lot of respect for these people. A lot.

  <DialogBubble people="3">
    I'll put it bluntly, in one sentence. All of Israel was f-ing shocked. No understatement. Because it came without any declaration of war. In the past, when we've been bombed, we've been told we're going to be bombed. This was a complete surprise. “50 years ago there was a doomsday war <i>(the military conflict between a coalition of Arab states and Israel that took place from 6 to 25 October 1973 — ed.)</i> let's relive old memories, let's do it again. Why not?” said Hamas and then "boom." And that's when things started to heat up in Israel, everyone, even those who kept calm before, was so shocked. Usually the spies on the other side tell Israel about attack plans, but this time they managed to pull off such a massive thing without any of us knowing about it. We weren't prepared for it. And it was massive. How they got so many good rockets that could reach so far is also a question.

    In the Russian-Ukrainian situation, the break from law and order can be considered terrorism because verything that came after this is terrorism. The break occured because of Putin’s orders, and those orders opened the door for this kind of terrorism of the people to occur.
  </DialogBubble>

<Medium>
  **When Hamas acted on the 7th, was it by order or was it the result of a similar break?**
</Medium>

<Large>
  <DialogBubble people="4">
    I think the Hamas organisation itself gave the order as vaguely as possible. It's like "attack the open air", that's it. And whatever you do after that is irrelevant. The order itself could be considered terrorist because it's too vague. Or maybe they said the same thing about Bucha: "We have to take Bucha," and then do whatever you want. It is not clear how that is different. 
  </DialogBubble>

  **Israel responded by deciding to destroy Hamas, attacking Gaza, a densely populated city. Do you think this is an appropriate response? If so, do you think Ukraine has the right to respond in a similar fashion for Bucha?**
</Medium>

<Large>
  <DialogBubble people="3">
    There's a nuance to what Israel is doing in Gaza. First of all, most people in Gaza support Hamas. Secondly, Israel does everything it can to avoid harming civilians. It says: “Please, on this day and at this time, take the civilians over here to the other side of Gaza so that we don't hit them. We believe that civilians are civilians.” But Hamas just says, "Civilians, you stay where you are.” They're just not allowed to move, as far as I know.

   Look, I don't think anyone deserves what's happening in Mariupol and Bucha. It's terrible. Yes, Putin gave the order, but the military did everything else. They raped children, they burned their bodies afterwards. That was the military's decision. But nobody deserves what happened in our cities. No matter how Russia behaves, I still don't think they deserve that kind of thing. 
  </DialogBubble>

<Medium>
  **But in the case of Gaza and Israel, that is exactly what is happening - retaliatory bombing. Is that a normal response to terrorist aggression?**

  <DialogBubble people="1">
   It's horrible! 
  </DialogBubble>
  <DialogBubble people="2">
   I agree. Nobody deserves this, war is not normal, and even though drones flew into Moscow, there will be nothing in Russia like what is happening in Gaza, because all Ukraine wants is peace and its land back. That's why they gave up their nukes.  
  </DialogBubble>
  <DialogBubble people="3">
    I think this question is a bit off. I don't think any of this is normal. It's not normal that somebody started it and it's not normal that somebody continued it. It's just that everything that's happening is not normal. You can't call anything normal right now. The only way it will be normal is if it stops somehow, but there is no normal any more.
  </DialogBubble>
  <DialogBubble people="4">
    Firstly, you compared Gaza and St Petersburg perfectly <i>(irony — ed.)</i>. Secondly, I absolutely agree that no one deserves this and no one should do it. But the Gaza issue is too complicated for me to answer. It should be a collective decision in the Tel Aviv parliament. Nobody deserves it, but somehow you have to show that you are serious and that you don't want this kind of terror to ever occur again. But how to do that is not clear. If you destroy something on their territory, they will only continue to act in the way they did. And if you don't do anything, you're not showing them anything that will deter them.

  **We decided to discuss the issue of "ambiguity" separately. When Bucha happened, the whole world had a unanimous opinion: "This is not right.” Everyone was horrified. There is no consensus regarding the history of Israel and Gaza. The world community has completely different attitudes to the two atrocities. What do you think?**

   Everyone is divided about Israel because they are shooting at us from Gaza for obvious reasons: they don't think the territory is ours and they don't want it to be.

  **But Putin has the same ideas. Sasha has a counter-argument: there are similarities, but the histories are different - that's why the world is divided. Ukraine has always been in favor of peace, and Israel (here Sasha states that she is sure that everyone is in favor of peace, of course) has always had these wars and was ready for them. Even though this situation is horrible, people were even more horrified by Ukraine because the country wasn't ready. At this point, Olya decides to end a difficult topic in an elegant way.**

  **At the end of the interview, we asked how the kids’ attitude to the military had changed.**

    Before the war I never saw the military. But now my great-uncle is at the front. I called him by video link, he was in uniform and I felt proud that this man is fighting for peace in the country. He understands that he could lose his life for other citizens. And I have great respect for people like that.

    My grandfather was a general in the Soviet army. And in Odessa in August 2021, I saw the military for the first time at a parade. They were guarding an LGBT-related and abortion-related parade. I saw the military blocking all the entrances and exits with machine guns and I was very scared. My father also has a young friend at work, he was recently recruited [into the army] and I remember him helping us around the house. And I feel so sorry that people like that are taken away. I have a friend who will be taken away soon. I am afraid for them.

    Sasha, I understand what you mean, my great-uncle is hiding from the summons in Odessa right now. He is half disabled and has health complications now, but they gave him a summons anyway. I'm afraid for him in general.

   I was also afraid for my father. Although he is 54, the draft age is 60, and I was afraid that he would be taken away. There were checks on buses and so on. In general, I worry a lot about my relatives and friends who have been called up. Of course it is good that they are defending us, themselves, their relatives, but I feel so sorry for them! I feel sorry for everyone in this situation.

    I have a very ambivalent feeling about the military in Russia. On the one hand, those who join the military are good because they want to defend the country, but on the other hand, they know what they are doing and what orders they will be given. They can be given orders to break up a rally, to beat people with sticks — that's all — or they can be told: "We are going to be attacked, go and protect our people". So it's a very ambivalent feeling.

    I have a very good relationship with the soldiers in Israel. The military and the police are very close to me for some reason, and I have experienced kindness from both. I have someone in my family who served in the army. Now my aunt has volunteered. She's not in the middle of a battle, she's a scout, according to satellite photos. And there are a huge number of volunteers in Israel, and there is a special respect for them, because they are willing to give up their work, some of their own affairs, to fly from another country to help. And I am very proud to live with them in the same country.

    I have a lot of respect for those who fight Hamas, and in fact I even have some respect for normal people who are just following orders from Hamas, not terrorists. I'm not sure if there are any such people really. But if there are, I have some respect for them too. And I also have respect for the people who live there and try to resist it. Those, again, are very few, but they're probably out there too. 

    But I would like to talk about cookies. I have an acquaintance who has an acquaintance who has a grandmother who lives near Gaza. And she baked cookies for Hamas, and that's how she stopped them. Our military came in and killed them.

  *"I have an acquaintance who has an acquaintance who has a grandmother" — at this point Sasha amusingly uses her hands to show the complexity of these relationships.*
