  I'm Ilya and I'm from Poltava, Ukraine. I'm 17 years old now. After the war started, I moved to Berlin. I'm passionate about programming and rock climbing. I got to know the imhr.top project and offered my help: I rewrote the website on Next.js so that the editorial team could add new articles more easily. This was one of my first real projects as a front-end developer. The war made me speed up my programming learning. Here in Berlin I have improved my skills a lot because I realized this is a situation when I need to push ahead. Working on the site, I wanted my story to be here as well. I'll tell about my life in Poltava, the beginning of the war, the move and plans.

  ## Life in Poltava

  I studied in Poltava until 11th grade and had to take the ZNO exam. It's a test for university admission. But it wasn't going too well. On average, I wrote tests for 130 points out of 200, which is not very good. I wasn't aiming to get into a prestigious university. I was thinking maybe Kharkiv National University named after Karazin or Kyiv Polytechnic. But in general, it didn't matter much. Mostly I was procrastinating at home, hanging out at a friend's apartment or playing computer games. 

  My mother was a choir conductor, my stepfather was a German language tutor, and my father was the head of local Western Union. Just a normal life. All of this has had an influence on my destiny. Now, after moving to Berlin because of the war, it seems like it all wasn't just coincidental.

  ## February ‘22

  I had been sick with coronavirus at the end of January. It was unpleasant. I spent the month in quarantine. Then I went back to school for three days and then war broke out. On February 24th, I woke up, looked out the window—everything was normal, then I checked my class chat and it said "no need to go to school today". I was pleased, although I already knew the reason. It was a bit awkward but that's how it was. 

  In Poltava, everything was quiet. In fact, even when the Russian forces began bombing civilian infrastructure, only one drone flew there. I felt quite safe, although the background anxiety was there, of course. But during the first week of the war, before leaving for Berlin, I just played computer games.

  ## Road to Berlin

  My mother conducted a choir in Poltava. Five years ago, they went on tour to Germany with the choir. There she met an elderly family from Berlin. They became friends, and she went to visit them again. As soon as the war began, my mother immediately decided that we had to leave. She called her friends and they agreed to let us stay with them. That was lucky. I know that not all refugees from Ukraine were so lucky.

  First we had to get to Lviv, then to the border with Poland, and then to Berlin. At the railway station, we were seen off by my father and stepfather. We left with the following composition: me, my mother, my aunt with a child and my godmother with three children. The express train to Lviv was free, so people were crammed into it. I sat near the toilet, the train was shaking, but we made it.

  My godmother is Protestant, so the church in Lviv was very helpful to us. We stayed there overnight, they fed us, thank them. Also, the priest of the church had some acquaintances at the railway station, so we were able to move forward in the queue for the train to the border. That was also luck. Some people had to wait in line for eight hours.

    The usual suburban train took us to the Polish border for seven hours. Seven hours is a lot for such a route. It turned out, it was making a detour. After two hours of the journey I looked at the navigator, where we were. It turned out that we were just slightly to the north of Lviv. The train was also packed, people were standing. It was a hard journey.

    This train took us to the Polish city of Helme, which is right on the border with Ukraine. There were free taxis that took refugees to different cities. We were taken to the city of Lublin, where we were settled in a hotel for three days. It was great there: lots of food and comfort. We had a very good time during those three days. Then we went by bus to Berlin to my mother's friends.

## In Berlin

  Their house was big. We were a lot of people, but I still had my own room. It was very cool. Seeing this house, I realized that it pays off to work for the government in Germany. The owner used to be a firefighter, now he has a great pension and lots of social benefits. In general, we live well.

  Five days after arriving in Berlin, I was sent to a German school. It's a high school, they say it's cool. There was an interview with the principal in English. She had a very good opinion of me.

  At first I was in 11th grade as an observer, but I realized I had to go to 10th grade to pass all the German exams. This opens up more opportunities. I have good grades in math and physics. And also German became level B1. And here my stepfather helped me. He's a German tutor, remember? We did it twice a week, he prepared me. Another pleasant coincidence. I'm lucky. By the way, my stepfather has a cottage in Dikan'ka, the one in Gogol's books. Just these evenings on the farm he held online classes with me.

  At school, I don't have very good relations with the Germans. I can't explain properly why. Maybe it's a language or some other barrier. But I have two friends from Odessa. Although we don't hang out much, we just go to school and talk there.

  But for a good cause it turns out to be possible to come together. So we organized a fundraiser at school for the children's hospital in the city of Rovno. We managed to raise 11,000 euros. This is a good result. There was even a news article about us in the local newspaper.

  My mom got a job singing in a choir. She cannot live without it, it's her life. She doesn't lead the choir anymore, there is its own conductor. But there are exceptions to every rule. Mom is so good at conducting the composition "Shchedrik" (it is a Ukrainian folk Christmas song) that she substitutes the conductor on this song. After each rehearsal I go meet my mom, so I got to know many cool creative people. For example, one of the choir singers is studying Russian, we talk to each other, she speaks Russian well.

  We often have video calls with my father and stepfather. We have good relationships with everyone. My father has a lot of work at Western Union now. Due to the war, there is a lot of load on transfers and logistics. It has become very important and in demand. I can see during the calls how tired he is, but he doesn't lose his spirit. Due to the war in Ukraine, not everything is smooth with work, so it's good that he became a specialist in demand now, there is an opportunity to earn.

  ## The Second breath in programming

  I started writing code in fourth grade when my father enrolled me in a computer academy called “Step”. They taught everything from Photoshop to C language. The coolest thing was that my father also went there to study adult courses. Later, when I didn't understand something, he just sent me materials from their adult classes, and I read them. That's why I was good at programming.

  In fifth or sixth grade there was an assignment to code a website in HTML and CSS according to certain requirements. But I ignored those requirements and did whatever I wanted.

  I also have a friend from Poltava named Kostya, who is a bit older. He also got into programming early. I remember when I was coding in HTML and CSS and he was creating scripts in JQuery. He was also interested in Arduino boards. In general, he was a great inspiration.

  I began to try JavaScript in the 10th grade in Poltava. But it was tough. I read learnjavascript, but somehow I couldn't get it down properly. Then Kostya signed up for a bootcamp. There the scheme is such that you study for free, they help with job placement, and then you pay the school 17% of your salary. I was also going to do this, I was already seriously preparing to go there. So seriously that my procrastination allowed me.

  Then there was the war, Berlin, Kostya went to Prague, got a job as a junior developer there. I realized that I had to stop being lazy. I started watching video courses on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux - the most popular in web development right now. I got interested, and things started working out. Now I'm taking a more serious approach. Life now tells me that I need to strive to get ahead. Before the war and the move, it didn't seem so important, but now it does.

  Kostya recently went to Prague and stayed with him. We keep in touch. He still inspires me a lot, even though now I feel I'm at his level of knowledge and programming skills.

  I have done several projects, and I recently rewrote imhr.top. I showed my friend's recruiter my resume and portfolio recently. She said if I were a bit older, I could already apply for jobs now. This gave me confidence.

  I am currently in 10th grade. I have not yet received all the necessary German certificates, but I have realized that I do not want to go to university. I used to think I wanted to, but I realized that my mom wanted me to go there more than I did. Instead, I am going to use an interesting scheme in German education. After 10th grade, you can start a professional training. In Ukraine there are all kinds of technical schools, but here you can go to a real company and work three days and study two. This is considered a continuation of your education, a technical specialty. After such training-work, the chances of getting an invitation from the company where it takes place are close to 100%. The only problem is usually boring work on outdated technologies. But that's still experience.

  While I was living in Poltava, there was no prospect of leaving there and enrolling in a good educational institution. Now I'm in Berlin, and it seems that there is such a prospect, so motivation appeared. The war took a lot from me, but on the other hand, some new opportunities opened up. I'm trying to think that way now.
