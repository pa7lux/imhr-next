  **About the occupation of Kherson, bike rides through the ghost town, reconnaissance markings, and pancakes during the war.**
  **The conversation was recorded by <a href="/en/posts/odessa-tbilisi">Sasha Trach</a> and Lisa Marantidi.**

*Sasha:* How did you find out about the war?

*Kolya:* Me and my friends were riding bikes in the center all week because there was no school due to quarantine. And then I wake up and immediately write to Artem: "So, Artem, when are we riding bikes to the center?"

My mom walks into the room:  
– Kolya, there's a war.   
– Mom, what are you kidding about? Don't joke, come on. 
– What joke, Kolya, come to your senses. There's a war, I'm telling you.  

I sat down, thought about it - I see that she's not joking. And in my head, I'm thinking: the 21st century, what war, are you all crazy? My first thoughts were that it's impossible, unreal, how can this be?

I never thought about LNR and DNR, about what was happening there all this time. Now I understand that all these jokes about Donbass - like they renamed Donbass to Bombass - it's not a joke at all, it's a pretty serious topic that needed to be talked about, not joked about. I'm ashamed that I closed my eyes to it.

In general, I felt lost, but the first days of the war were fun in their own way.

*Sasha:* Fun?

*Kolya:* I had never heard a plane fly so close before. In the first few days, we watched TV with the lights off (while there was still power, internet, hot water, etc.). And suddenly there was this whistling sound that almost deafened me. I thought it was a rocket, that they were bombing like in Donbass, and I jumped to the floor. My mom said, "What's wrong with you, it's just a plane."

But perhaps the most interesting stories were in the basements. We hardly took anything with us when we went there for the first time. There were just too many explosions, and everyone decided to open the basement. It's not a five-star hotel, of course, but it's okay. The first impression when you go in is that it's a Khrushchev-era apartment from which everything has been removed. There were only a bunch of bedside tables where people sat. Everyone was praying and crying, while I sat there thinking about what I could do. I decided to take a book or a laptop, or even better, play cards with the neighbor. We played for a long time, and then everyone went back to their homes. Our basement get-togethers usually lasted about three hours.

Afterwards, everyone remembered that they could throw a fragmentation grenade in there, and it wouldn't be great. Besides, there was no way to escape, there was only one entrance and exit. Well, only if you went to other rooms, but you would still be reached there. There were five spacious rooms in the basement: a storage room where neighbors dumped unwanted items, several other rooms, and a grate leading to another entrance, where there was also a basement. We were afraid of those grates because we thought they could throw a grenade in there. But the guys quickly reacted, partitioned it off, and patched it up.

In general, we spent the first few days there just sitting around. My mom came up with various entertainment programs for the children and organized games, while I often chatted with the adults – playing cards, discussing the situation and all that. Later on, we became more daring and started venturing out onto the street before curfew. But still, we were like basement dwellers. It sounds like we were homeless people.

*Sasha:* Like cavemen.

*Kolya:* Yeah, something like that. There was this one guy, he worked as a firefighter I think. One day, he got drunk and came down to the basement. Later on, he went out onto the street with some other guys and there was a car playing some Russian music. He approached them and started asking questions. The guys tried to take him away, but he kept asking, "Who does Crimea belong to?" and something about some "naked devil."

*Sasha:* "Naked devil" – that's good. Even Gogol couldn't come up with something like that.

*Kolya:* Yeah, well that's just nonsense. The car eventually drove off. But what was really scary were the markings. Markings were these drawings, for example, on the asphalt that would reflect when you shine a light on them. Everyone thought that when a plane flies over, it sees the marking and drops a missile there. There were also markings for reconnaissance. Sometimes there were even fake markings. I don't really understand how it worked, but sometimes these guys in black would come, climb up the transformer, put the marking there, and then leave. There were a lot of them in our area.

One day, we were standing near the basement when a neighbor from the next building came up to us and said that there was a marking on the transformer. The men's faces changed, they threw their cigarettes on the ground, and ran to the transformer. They climbed up onto the big box and looked, but there was nothing there. Because in reality, the women in our group were the ones who were prone to panic. The men tried to remain calm, and my mother was a real fighter.

*Sasha:* What did people in the basements do in general?

*Kolya:* Many things. Some people read books or listened to music, while others, like me, played cards or got lost in their laptops. Once, I was even called "Anonymous" because I type fast. I still don't understand how that's related, as I was just using a calculator since there was no internet connection. You know, there's a special setting for notepads and calculators where images made out of numbers appear, and you control them. But I wasn't doing that. I was just multiplying two plus two. Eventually, we all left the basements because there were rumors that they could come and take us hostage, which was not ideal. Because of this, we all started staying at home until something serious happened.

*Sasha:* What do you think about the referendums on transferring Kherson to the Russian Federation?

*Kolya:* There were some elderly people accompanied by a few soldiers going around homes, asking people to sign a petition for the referendum. If people didn't sign, they were taken out of Kherson and made to walk to Ukraine without their belongings.

  >### My friend sent me some figures, like 76% of people signed the referendum and 86% voted, even though 70% of people had left Kherson.

<Medium>
*Sasha:* Yeah, a calculator won't help with that. Instead of an answer, you'll just see images.

*Kolya:* Right, two plus two doesn't add up. In general, the situation in the city was such that the stores had minimal supplies, and everything became more expensive. My favorite Coca-Cola in a small bottle used to cost 9 hryvnias, but it became 20. We had to go to the market to buy products at normal prices. By the way, everything was absolutely fine with the internet, electricity, and hot water.

*Sasha:* So, you spent most of the occupation of Kherson in the city?

*Kolya:* Yes. But when the Russian military left Kherson, that's when the problems with water and electricity started. I liked to play games, but sometimes my mom would grab me by the collar and say, "To the market, quickly." And sometimes, during the war, my mom would start making pancakes, and I had to go get some sour milk. I would run with such joy, "Hooray, sour milk, pancakes, hooray!" But, in reality, I didn't like going to the market. It takes a long time, two to three hours in the heat, back and forth, with purchases.

*Sasha:* What particularly annoyed you during the occupation?

*Kolya:* Orange and black ribbons on Victory Day. That's my least favorite thing. When I see them, some kind of trigger goes off in my head. You look at those banners and it says, "We won." The red star, that ribbon, and the symbol of the USSR.

We also have two famous theaters in our city: the DKT and the Jubilee. The Jubilee is my favorite, that's where Max Barskyh performed, and many others too. We walked around there with relatives during the occupation. And now I see that our theater is now the center of humanitarian aid of United Russia, not the Jubilee. There were a lot of Russian soldiers there. I wanted to give each of them a slap, and then say goodbye to everyone, because I think that would immediately knock some sense into them. But with the DKT, everything seemed to be normal. People say they closed themselves off and ate and drank, they had their own life there.

*Liza:* Did your feelings change compared to the beginning of the war?

*Kolya:* Explosions became something absolutely normal. When I heard the first explosion, I thought someone was setting off fireworks in the morning, something like that. But after a week, I stopped caring. Because you quickly get used to everything that happens every day. I got used to going to the market, to the fact that everything was very expensive in stores, to explosions, and to the fact that you can easily see Russian military personnel on the street.

*Lisa:* What did you feel when you passed by Russian military personnel?

*Kolya:* Hatred. I understood that they were following orders, but even without those orders, they were committing such atrocities that you could only ask, are you scumbags or...

*Sasha:* Monsters?

*Kolya:* Monsters, yes. But in reality, I'm a bit disappointed with people from Kherson too. We had two shopping centers, and one of them burned down at some point. I don't know if a missile hit it or someone set it on fire. And I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/rjBVodVzPtU" target="_blank">video</a>, of our people taking things out of there by the cartload. And a man from Kherson was filming it and saying, "You pigs." I fully agree with him on that point. 

*Sasha:* Yes, we also had a shopping center that burned down, and it was incredibly cool. There was a cable car inside, and you would pedal and ride from above and see everything. Although no one took anything out of it, it was just super annoying that I won't be able to pedal those pedals anymore.

*Kolya:* Yes, well, we just boarded everything up with bricks afterwards. We rode there on our bikes once, the place was completely trashed. I even saw some Russians there, they were looking at the building and laughing. I approached them, said something vulgar and left. Because laughing at something like that is idiocy. Essentially, they took away people's only entertainment.

*Sasha:* Were you not afraid to ride bicycles around the city?

*Kolya:* Actually, in that sense, we were optimistic. We just did what we were used to. Sometimes we even rode towards the city center, where there was one of the most dangerous areas in the city. We didn't even think that we could be shot calmly. But we could have, probably. But it was rather scary because of what the city had turned into. On the roadside, there were all kinds of broken trucks, military vehicles, the ATB store was closed, some cars were on fire - it was like an apocalypse or a ghost town. And when you see someone, you try to get away so much that you actually end up just riding into some courtyard. But in general, I wasn't afraid of death specifically. I lived by the principle of "we live while we can."

  >### Anything could happen: a bomb could fly into a house, or you could get hit by debris, or a car could hit you, or you could be shot - all of this was considered. And of course, my mom was worried at first when she let me out on the street.
</Large>

<Medium>
But maybe I was a nihilist back then. It was scary to go out at first, but then I realized that if I stayed home, I would just go crazy. And as long as nothing happened to me, I would walk around, do what I liked, and if there was any danger, I would probably slow down.

*Lisa:* How much time passed between the "first time" and your decision to lead a normal life?

*Kolya:* About a month. Then we even turned on the lights in the house without fear. Life became ordinary, just with small changes. Well, big small changes.

*Sasha:* How did you finally decide to leave?

*Kolya:* We were already in a very bad financial situation. A piece of meat could cost a thousand hryvnias. And my mom's friend offered to take us away. When I found out about the move, I was amazed. I hadn't left Kherson for three years, maybe only to go to Mykolaiv. In general, I was happy, I had long dreamed of celebrating my birthday abroad. But at the same time, it was scary, it was unclear where and how to live in a foreign country.

*Sasha:* So, what are your future plans?

*Kolya:* Well, it's unclear at the moment. Most likely, we will leave Georgia. I don't know what I will do after finishing the tenth or eleventh grade. I have no idea where I will go after that, but I want to study to become a chef. I don't want to sit behind a computer, I'd rather be in the kitchen cooking.

*Sasha:* I think you'll change your mind a million times.

*Kolya:* Let's be honest, my potato dish was good, right? It was good. I should become a chef.

*Sasha:* Well, that's good to hear.
