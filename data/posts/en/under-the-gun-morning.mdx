  **The story of how the Russian military searched for swastika pictures, confiscated telephones, interrogated the father, and put an assault rifle in the brother's hand.**
  **A conversation was recorded by <a href="/en/posts/odessa-tbilisi">Sasha Trach</a> and Kolya Zaruitin.**

*Dusya:* It was the 9th of March. At that time I slept badly and kept waking up. It was gray weather and it was quiet, quiet, quiet. Suddenly there was a heavy knock on the window of my parents' bedroom and a call rang out, "Open up, open up!" I lay there thinking, "Maybe it's the neighbors - some kind of shelling has started or something. If anything, mom will come get me." I turn over and lie back down. Dad gets up, goes to the door, opens it, and already I hear, "Lie down! On the floor! One move and I'll shoot you down!" I didn't understand at all what was going on - five o'clock in the morning, immediately the thought: maybe they'll take dad away. What to do in such a situation?

Then the military stormed the house. Dad was lying on the floor outside. I saw everyone going to the second floor while others tried to open a second entrance. Dad said, "Come on, don't break it, I'll open it for you in a minute." No problem, we have nothing to hide. He just comes up and they opened it without damaging anything. We were just shocked. Immediately they took away our phones. We had four phones in the family: my brother's, my mother's, my father's and mine. Mine was in the pillows, it was two percent charged and on silent. So basically no one could notice. I thought if they didn't give the phones back, we wouldn't have a connection. Well, I didn't want them to take it away either - I had saved up for it. I quickly shove it under the pillows with my hand and turn on my acting skills. And then mom said, "Dusya, where's your phone?" Well, that's it, I'm done, "Yes, here it's, mom, take it, oh, I forgot it" - well, somehow it worked.

Generally they took the phones and demanded passwords. Then all the closets, dressers were opened, parents are asked to get dressed. They say, "The children stay at home, the parents go with us". We were shocked - how can the children stay? A lot of unknown men in the house. I'm alone at home with my brother and sister, what can I do? Lots of men with guns. Mom says, "What do you think? And who will the kids be with?" And the boss points at me, "Well, is that your daughter? She's going to stay here." It was scary, they can rape and do anything. The parents started getting dressed, well, because there was no other choice, they just asked if they could at least wash.

Some high ranking military people came in and asked if there were swastika signs, drugs, weapons or anything unusual. My mother replied, "What do you mean? What kind of swastika? We don't have anything like that here." In the end, they decided that my mother could stay with us, but my father was taken away for further questioning. They said that if he wasn't involved in anything, he'd come back and everything would be fine. We were worried, but sat down.

    *Dusya:* — That's really scary.
    *Sasha:* — No, it's just fireworks.
    *Kolya:* — Flashback.
    *Dusya:* — Yeah, yeah.
    *Kolya:* — That's too realistic.
    *Sasha:* — And now the windows are shaking.

*Dusya:* I'm getting dressed, and one man says:

  > ### "Basically, you can move around the house freely, just not quickly, because you're always being monitored. If you have another means of communication, don't call anyone, just give it up. Since we have blocked the connection, we'll track you down immediately."

Well, we don't have anything. Mom says, "Will you take some valerian?" I say, "Sure." And there was a soldier sitting nearby. I drank some valerian, then I felt a little better, it was kind of normal. We started talking about nothing, just so we wouldn't be sitting here shaking:

— Where are you from?  
— From Russia.  
— And how far?  
— Far enough.

Then the boss came in and sat down on the couch. My six-year-old brother woke up (he had been awake from the beginning, but had been told to close his eyes, which he did and fell back asleep). He woke up and sat there quietly. The boss said to him:

— Do you want to hold a Kalashnikov rifle in your hand?  
— Sure, why not.  
— Here you go.  
— Wow, it's heavy.  
— And I've a pistol, too. 

My brother was holding a gun. Another soldier said:

I am sitting there watching the whole thing and I am thinking, "My God, what are the chances that we are not going to be taken away and shot right now? Zero chance of that not happening. That's fifty-fifty. Are you going to survive or not?" You do not know yourself and you are just sitting there thinking, "My God" Then the chief says, "What are you hiding?" And my brother answers him, "Oh, I have a gun too". That is, it was probably designed so that the child would say, "Oh, and my father has a gun too." But we do not have it and what is he going to say? He'll just show his kid's and that's it. Well, he brought his plastic gun that he bought before the war.

We keep sitting, it's almost eight of the clock, they tell us, "If you want, you can start getting ready. Where do you have to go? School, kindergartens. You have to go somewhere." My mother and I exchange glances, "We have not been to the kindergartens in at least a month. They are all closed." They say, "Oh, really?" I thought if they asked, "Why?" it would be a total disaster, I would reply, "Well, you came to "free" us."

*Sasha:* You have also already "liberated" the school. 
</Medium>

<Medium>
*Dusya:* Yes. Then they say, "Well, your children will wake up soon, they may want to eat, so you can prepare food." But I also have a three-year-old sister who had not woken up at that time. We thought, "Lord, we just can not get a lump in our throat, what are you talking about?"

—  Do not worry about it, everything will be fine, your father will come soon and that's it.  

Father came back with the phones, the soldiers left. The end.

After that, it became so scary to stay at home that we started looking around at every rustle.

Father then told us that about half an hour before all this happened, he had seen a light in the window and heard a crackling sound. This time he decided that something was wrong with his eyes, but he sometimes went around the area just to check, because banditry was strong in our town. When questioned, he said, "Listen, if I had opened the door earlier to go around the house as a precaution, would you have just shot me?" They replied, "No, we would have just come to you earlier."
