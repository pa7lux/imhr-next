*Dusya:* This event happened on the night of 9 March. I was sleeping quite poorly and woke up several times. It was gloomy and very quiet. Out of the silence, I suddenly hear someone knocking on a the window of my parents’ bedroom with voices shouting “Open, open now!”. I was in my bed, contemplating what this could be. Maybe, these were my neighbors, or maybe there was an attack. My mom would then wake me. So I turned around and stayed in bed. My father got up and approached the door. He opened it and immediately I heard: “Get down! On to the floor! Do not move or I’ll shoot to kill!” I did not understand what was happening, it was just 5 AM. I got worried and thought that they were taking my dad away. What would one do in such a situation?

Right after that the soldiers ran into our house, and my father lay on the ground outside. I saw everyone climbing up the stairs, other soldiers were trying to open a second gate. My father asked them to wait and not break the gate, promising he would open it for them, we had nothing to hide from these soldiers. As he got close, they had opened it already, without breaking. We were sitting just all shocked. Very quickly they took all of our mobile phones. Four of us had phones: brother, mother, father and me. Mine was under the pillows, with only 2% of the battery remaining and muted. So basically no one could find it. I thought to myself, if they do not give back our phones, we would have no communication. And also I didn’t want them to take it, because I had saved money to buy the phone. I tucked it deeper into the pillows and started acting innocent. And exactly at this moment, my mother asks me : “Dusya, and where is your phone?” After all this drama, i returned my phone “Yes, here, mom, take it, I forgot about it”.

So, they took our mobile phones and demanded PIN-codes. After that they opened all the closets, lockers and told my parents to get dressed. They said: “Children stay at home, parents are going with us.” We were shocked: how could we leave kids? Lots of sleazy men in the house. If I was left alone with my brother and sister, what could I do? All men had guns. Mother said: “How so? With whom will the kids stay?” Their leader pointed at me: “Is this your daughter? They’ll stay with her.” It was terrible; they could rape me or do as they please. Parents started to dress just because we had no other choice; they only asked if they could go wash themselves.

Another high ranked soldier entered and asked: “Do you have any swastikas, drugs, guns, anything suspicious, not-traditional? Mom answered: “What do you mean? What swastikas? What’s that? We have none of this.” They concluded that my mother had to stay with us and took my father away for interrogation. They said that if he was not involved in anything, he would be back and everything would be alright. Worried, we took our places.

    *Dusya:* — That’s scary.
    *Sasha:* — No, it's just fireworks.
    *Kolya:* — Flashbacks.
    *Dusya:* — Yes, that’s it.
    *Kolya:* — The storytelling is way too realistic.
    *Sasha:* — And glass panes are vibrating now.

*Dusya:* I got dressed. They told us:

  > ### “You can move freely in the house, just move slowly because you will always be under our gun. If you have any other means of communication, do not call anyone, give them phones away right now. We shall shut off the network, we’ll track you down straight away”

Well, we had nothing. Mom asked me: “Do you need valerian drops to calm down?” I said “Yes”. A soldier was sitting nearby. I took the tincture and felt somewhat better, almost back to normal. They started small talking just not to sit around like that, not to shake:

— And you, where’re you from?  
— From Russia.  
— Well, how far away?  
— Quite far.

Then their leader entered the room and took place on the sofa. My 6-year old brother woke up. He woke up once at the very beginning, but they told him to close eyes, he did so and fell asleep. So, he got up and sat calmly. The leader asked him:

— Do you want to hold Kalshnikov?  
— Hmm, yes.  
— Here, hold it.  
— Oh, it’s heavy.  
— Here, I also have a gun. 

Brother held it for some time too. And then another soldier said:

  > ### “Listen, I have a grenade too. Want to see?” And he got the grenade out in the house.

I was looking at that and thinking: “Oh, God, what are the odds that they just don’t take us out of the house and shoot? Zero probability that this wouldn’t happen. Well, it is fifty-fifty. Either you’ll live or die”. You wouldn’t know for sure, you’d sit there and think: “Dear God”. Then their leader said: “Hold it back, are you mad already?” At this moment my brother just spilled: “Me too, I also have guns”. He meant his toys. So, all this was intended to make him say: “Oh, my father also has guns”. But we didn’t have any, what would he say? He just brought his plastic toy gun that we had bought for him a little while ago, before the war.

We kept sitting, it was already around eight in the morning; they said: “If you want, you may get ready. Where do you need to go, they asked? To school or preschool. You need to go somewhere.” My mother and I looked at each other: “We are not going to preschool for almost a month. They are closed everywhere.” They replied: “Oh, really.” I thought if they’d have asked why, that would be completely and totally messed up and I would have replied to them: “Well, ‘cause you came to „liberate” us”.

*Sasha:* They had liberated the school already, for sure. 
</Medium>

<Medium>
*Dusya:* Yes. Then they said: “Well, your kids will get up soon, they’ll probably be hungry, you can cook for them”. My sister was just three years old. She did not wake up by this moment. We were thinking: “God, the food would be stuck in our throat, what are you talking about?”

—  Don’t worry, everything is going to be fine, your dad will come back and it’ll end.    

When our father came back, he brought phones, and the soldiers went away. That’s it.

After that, we felt so terrified at home that we kept looking around at every noise.

Father told us later that that night, just a half an hour before everything happened he saw some lights moving and heart crunches. That time he decided he had some troubles with eyes; but he used to go around sometimes just to check because looting was severe in our town. During the interrogation he said: “Listen, what if I opened the door earlier that night to go around, you would have shot me?” They answered: “No, we would have turned up at your home earlier.”
