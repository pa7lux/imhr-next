  **Memories of my home city and its forests, the road from occupied Kherson to Tbilisi and unfettered love for Minecraft, which unites all of us with friends.**

  My name is Maksim. I am thirteen, born in Kherson, Ukraine. My favorite sport is swimming. My favorite school subject was English. I have to say though, I am don’t particularly enjoy school… I dream of finishing it as soon as possible. My favorite country is United Kingdom, I always wanted to travel there. In my free time, I enjoy to play chess, cards, but my absolute favorite game is Minecraft. Right now, I live in Tbilisi, Georgia.

  ## Briefly about my city

  Here I am going to describe my home town of Kherson. Kherson is a small city, but a very cool one. The city has a lot of nature spaces for hanging out with friends. Our city is rich with big parks, unique fountains, cute cafes and beaches.

  Kherson sits on the Dnepr river and is next to the most beautiful forests where you can find all kinds of mushrooms, and swimmable lakes. We were always very proud of our attraction-shopping center “Fabrika”. The place had all you could ever need: cinema, shops, bowling, playgrounds, and much more.

  When we had good weather, and there was nothing to do at Fabrika, we would go run around the city’s downtown. My friends: Maks, Oleg, Artem and I, would often hang out on the Suvorova street – one of the widest streets of Kherson. We would also occasionally go on hikes in the Kherson outskirts, I will tell about them in a bit…

  ## Sports practices of my town

  I often traveled outside the city, for sports practice and for hikes. My first ever hike was with my Aikido club when I was ten years old. It was one of the best moments in my life.
  
  The hike was three years ago. We were going to the Oleshkov forest with around a fifty person group.

  We began our travel to the forests in two buses. During the ride, some people were traveling with us who taught us useful skills ahead of the hike. For example, they taught us how to use a compass and a map. Already in the forest, we started a fire, played many games, and of course we trained. We also found a giant log which we decided to carry all the way back home. The hike back took us 5 hours.

  Just a year ago, my step-father and I went on another hike with a small group. We got on the bus at six in the morning and began our travels towards a village neither of us visited before. We were told that the hike would be around 40 kilometers, which made me feel a little down since my legs were sore since last night’s trainings. Still, I told myself to keep my chin up.

  At first, we went in the forest where we went through made ponds and steep hills. In our next stage, we walked through a more desert-like area. It was hot outside; I, of course, forgot my cap so I put on a bandana and kept on through the hike.

  Throughout our hike, we saw many bushes and lizards under them. More importantly, we came across a miracle! At some point, as if god sent, we came across a shop “ezhik”(translated as hedgehog), where there was an abundance of ice cream and cold water. We got ourselves some minty ice at the shop and we continued our hike through the forest… I began to recognize the forest surroundings- I saw my favorite lake where we go swimming every other weekend.

  ## From Kherson to Tbilisi, through entire Russia, in forty five days.

  While there were bombings or other war actions, my mother and step-father played monopoly and other games at home. When it’s quiet, we played in the bedroom. When it became loud, we moved to the corridor. We stayed at our home for a week, during which I began drawing again. After a week, we began to go outside; I even got out on a bike ride. We were asked not to go to the city squares because there were protests. My godmother and grandmother went to protests, but I didn’t – my life is worth more.

  My family soon began to buy up food and prepare our bunker. In the grocery stores there were eggs, green beans, corn, and bread.

  We decided to risk and travel to Tbilisi because our travel passports were soon to expire. We stopped in Crimea for a couple days where we stayed with mom’s friend. Unfortunately, we had to make another pit stop when our car broke down. We kind of fixed it, but the car still couldn’t go uphill. Sometimes it even turned off completely, so we had to get people to help us tow it. At every checkpoint, we were asked questions about the special operation; only my step-father answered.

  We got to Tbilisi after all. There, volunteers helped us find a hostel. They also roomed us with a grandmother (babushka) from Kyiv, who wouldn’t eat buckwheat and hated Georgian people. One time, the babushka became very angry when someone accidentally added tomatoes into her salad and began screaming hysterically.

  Thankfully we found an apartment in only a few days and the rest of our summer was spent calmly. We walked around Tbilisi, went on many tours, I found new friends, and, of course, played a lot of Minecraft.

  In September, I began going to a new school. I really like it here, but all the tables are singles; I can’t cheat of my classmates… Maybe we will try throwing paper balls – I think we have quite a talent for that. 

  My father, my dog, and a couple other relatives stayed in Kherson. I call my dad very often. It seems like all is okay with him as he says he mostly sits at home.

  ## Kirochka City – our Minecraft city.

  Minecraft was created in 2009 and rapidly gained popularity. In 2022, over 170 million people play Minecraft every month.

  My friends: Maks, Matvey, Ilya, Yarik, and a couple other guys who went on the hike with me, started our first server called Kirochka in 2018. The server was started with the hope that each one can find something to do so they’re not bored. We still play on the server today.
  
  Initially, the server existed just for the fun of those who started it. After a month, I began working on improving the server.

  Our only principle is that the Kirochka server will not have modes or packs.

  We called the city Kirochka sity. Initially, the city population was fifteen people (??). The construction jobs were done by only four people. Except for hotel, par, cemetery, and a park the city didn’t have anything else.

  Soon we built entire living blocks, a big bank, and a university. We all really enjoyed building, so the city was growing very quickly; and our server’s team had group to 30 people.

  Our server will be fully completed in a year.

  I took on the responsibility of creating unique items and controlling the server mechanics.

  Eventually, our team had even grown to 70 people!

  But our server is administrated only by 6 people.

  Our new team helped to build: hospital, a military draft center, police academy, and a townhall. Everyone contributed idea on how to improve the city.

  By the way, Kirochka City also has a Suvorov street. Next to it, we built a park where there are three monuments, a couple small cafes and a few walking trails. There, you can also found the shop “Ezhik”, where it sells ice cream and much more.
