  On the morning of February 23rd, my mom, sister and I congratulated my dad on February 23, which is Defender of Fatherland's Day. We gifted him a hoodie and socks. That day I went to art class. We drew a square for three whole hours, which I was not very happy about. The teacher said that my square was cramped and stuffy and I needed to give it some air.

  On my way home, I remembered that we were assigned to learn verses by heart. But I didn't do my homework.  Instead, I watched a movie and went to bed. And then came the morning of February 24th.

  ## 5 a.m., February 24th

  At 5 a.m. my parents woke me up and told me we were being bombed.

  I answered sleepily, "Yup‚Ä¶‚Äù

  I'll be honest, I didn't care at first., Then one of the rockets landed quite closeby Instead of hiding, I screamed: "MAMA!"

  Three hours later, my parents sent me to the grocery store for buckwheatüëç. While standing at the checkout, I found out that the card was not accepted.

  I began to sprint home and called my friend to tell her that there were explosions nearby. I was in tears. She tried to calm me down.

  If anything, that day ended well; but one of our walls caught fire due to the wiring and we almost diedüëç.

  My dad freaked out, and bought a lot of vodka and brought a bag of potatoes. A few days later potatoes cost three times less.

## How am I doing right now?

  Now I'm in Tbilisi, and everything is fine. I'm going to a new school. I really want to go home. I‚Äôve recently cried because I thought there was a chance we could go. But we didn‚Äôt I still have a cat and father back home in Odessa and I am truly worried about them.
